# PARETO RANK-PRESERVING SUPERNETWORK FOR HW-NAS
This code is associated with the paper "PARETO RANK-PRESERVING SUPERNETWORK FOR HW-NAS". We describe in this repository a methodology to train a supernetwork to accurately rank the architectures in a multi-objective context. 

You can run the algorithm on three different search spaces: NAS-Bench-201, DARTS and ProxylessNAS. 

## How to use
``` python train.py --arch 201 --epochs 10 ```
